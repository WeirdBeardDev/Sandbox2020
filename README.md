# Sandbox2020
A sandbox project using Unity 2020.2.0f1.

# IEnumerable Example Scene
I wrote an [article](http://weirdbearddev.com/2020/10/19/unitys-transform-implements-ienumerable/) and provided sample code about how `Transform` implements `IEnumerable` and described how you can use that to change materials on objects.

# Random Quest Factory Scene
I wrote an [article](http://weirdbearddev.com/2020/12/05/building-a-random-quest-generator/) about creating a no-maintenance factory to generate random quests.  The RandomQuestFactory (under Assets\_Game\Scenes) scene provides an example implementation for you to review.

# Custom Character Vol1
I needed a few test characters for a game I'm developing.  I added the free [Custom Character 2D Vol.1](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/custom-character-2d-vol-1-65144) package.  I took the existing sample character and created two more.
